qz.Quiz Usage Instructions

qz.Quiz can be used to either create or take multiple choice quizzes. To take a quiz, run the program with the "-t" flag. The default behavior is to create a quiz, but this can also be explicitly specified through the "-c" flag.

By default, a quiz will ask for the name of the quiz taker. To create an anonymous quiz, use the "-a" flag when creating it. To take a quiz anonymously that was not created using the "-a" flag, use the "-a" flag in combination with the "-t" flag.

After specifying all flags, the name of the quiz can be optionally specified. The default name of a created quiz will be "quiz.qz" unless otherwise specified; if no filename is specified and the "-t" flag has been raised, the program will search for a quiz "quiz.qz" in the current directory. All quizzes will be appended with a ".qz" tail, and all answer files with a ".ans" tail.

While creating a quiz, press the ENTER key to complete a question or answer. When all desired answers have been inputted, press answer on a blank answer line to complete the question. To complete the quiz, press the ENTER key on a blank question line.

While taking a quiz, the only acceptable responses to a question are the letters of the choices displayed for each question, in upper- or lower-case. To exit a quiz prematurely, enter the "quit" command.
